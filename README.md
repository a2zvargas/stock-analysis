# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project performs data analysis on stock market data to get total daily volume and yearly return percentage of a set of stocks.

## Results

Looking at the results of the stock analysis we see that almost every stock performed better in 2017 than in 2018.  All stocks but TERP had a positive rate of return over the year in 2017, but only stocks ENPH and RUN had a positive rate of return in 2018.  Although ENPH had a positive rate of return in 2018 at 81.9%, it had an even higher rate of return in 2017 with rate of return of 129.5%.  However, RUN improved from a 5.5% rate of return in 2017 to a 84% rate of return in 2018.  While TERP improved from a -7.2% rate of return in 2017 to a -5.0% rate of return in 2018 it remains a negative return.
